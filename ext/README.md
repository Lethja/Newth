# External library folder
Some build systems require external libraries to be built that are not part of the system.
When this is the case they can be put in a subdirectory here for organization

## Watt32
Copy or symlink `watt32s` root directory here so that it looks like this
```
ext/watt32s/inc
ext/watt32s/lib
```
